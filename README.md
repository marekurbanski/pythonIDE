# PythonIDE

- Idea of this project was, to create IDE to design and edit code in one place
- You can drag&drop components like "button", "textBox", "input" etc. on your Form
- Every compnent you can edit by actions "onClick" - IDE will add code for this action
- You can add you own style for every component by editing ObjectInspector
